###**throwaway-scripts**

A collection of throwaway bash scripts I've written over time. Too wasteful to throw away.

	cider: Expand and print IPv4 addresses in CIDR notation to standard output
	crib: Print a country's IPv4 prefixes in CIDR notation to standard output
	ipinfo: Print extra information about IPv4 address to standard output
	wimi: Print "what is my IP address?" every 60 seconds (default) to standard output
