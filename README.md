###**throwaway-scripts**

A collection of throwaway bash scripts I've written over time. Too wasteful to throw away.

**Overview**
- `cider: expand and print IP address in CIDR notation`
- `crib: print a country's IP blocks`
- `ipinfo: print extra information about IP address`
- `wimi: print "what is my IP address?"`
